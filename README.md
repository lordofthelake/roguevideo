# Rogue Video

Annoyed of the ads and popups in the video streaming sites? Me too!

## Usage

At the moment the application is just a proof-of-concept, written in an afternoon. It is tested only on Android 5.x and the only supported provider is [OpenLoad](https://openload.co/).

Once installed, the application it will simply ask to handle for you the links
for that domain. If you allow it, it will extract the video URL from the webpage for you, ready to be streamed or downloaded with your favorite player!
